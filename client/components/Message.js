           <p> Hello wonderful people, I am priya. I would like to introduce and invite you to join me in this concept/dream of
            catering revolution. I would like to tell you about what this concept is and how it emerged, I am Mum who is been at home
            for last 10 years looking after my kids. During this time I always wondered what and how can I get some employment when the hours
             my kids are at school. I came to know that it is not very easy to find a work which can suit my interests and time restrictions.
            Years went by and I realised something,,,,</p>
             <p> that one thing I knew  for sure was that I am passionate about cooking it works like mindfulness meditation for me it takes me away from all the stress, worries
             and helps me to be in a present moment and enjoy creating something mind blowing.
             That's where I decided to do something on my own in a very small way, cook and feed. I started with small 
             experiment which grew with a lot of support and help from family and friends and turned into success.
             This is where my concept/dream emerged. How about create a catering-platform for stay at home parents who are passionate
             about cooking. There are a lot of working families who don't have enough time to cook healthy food for their families and they depend on buying food from restaurants
             also same with students who are heavily dependent on food outside. So far we have seen Uber, Barnados etc.. How about similar concept with the catering?
             I feel this can bring  different cultures and community together, giving lot of stay at home parents some revenue while looking
             after thier family. At this stage I would like to invite to register your interest to go ahead with this concept.
            </p>
